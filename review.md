## What we would do differently

* Due to the circumstances, we were unable to meet in person, which caused some communication issues.

* As a team, we would agree on who have to merge in the end: the developer or the reviewer.

* We would meet in person to discuss our plan for the assignment.

* Leave code review on paper and not in private messages, in order to leave a paper trail on what changes were made. 
We would set the base structure of each section beforehand in order to prevent merge conflicts.

* We would train on creating branches, pull requests and releases before starting the project in order to get familiar with the gitflow process and github.
